Seems like most of the django based shopping carts out there are either underdeveloped or overkill. This app's goal is to use the power of Django to create a simple but powerful, flexible e-commerce solution. Leverages django's builtin admin interface and follows django best-practices.

This project is in beta, currently supporting paypal only for checkout.

Documentation and instructions to come shortly.
